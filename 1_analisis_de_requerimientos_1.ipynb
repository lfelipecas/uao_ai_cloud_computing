    "The phenomenon under study is the competitive process of awarding government contracts. The problem to address is the ability to predict the business group or profile to which an entity belongs, based on historical data. This analysis will allow companies to better understand their position in the market, and regulatory bodies to identify possible awarding patterns."

    "To address the classification problem, several models can be used:\n",
    "1. Logistic Regression: It is a good initial option due to its simplicity and efficiency, and although it is a binary classification algorithm, it can be extended to multi-class classification using a 'one vs. rest' approach to address the case of multiple winners.\n",
    "2. Decision Trees: They are a good option since the resulting models can be visualized and understood easily, and these algorithms are not affected by data scaling.\n",
    "3. Random Forests: These use decision trees as their fundamental components, and since decision trees tend to overfit the models to the training data, random forests are a way to cope with and handle this problem."
