Introduction to the Fiscal Year 2023 Data Loading Notebook\n","\n","This Jupyter notebook has been created to loading and initial processing of the fiscal year 2023 contract data. Given the large volume and complexity of the dataset, the notebook is structured to ensure efficient handling, loading, and preliminary inspection of the data, which forms the basis for further detailed analysis in the subsequent notebook '3_create_labels_for_fy_2023_companies.ipynb'.\n","\n","##### Notebook Objectives:\n","- **Data Loading**: Load the extensive CSV files containing detailed contract information for the fiscal year 2023. This process includes reading the data into a pandas DataFrame, which serves as the primary data structure for further operations.\n","- **Initial Data Cleaning**: Perform basic cleaning steps that prepare the data for analysis. This includes removing unnecessary columns that do not contribute to the analytical objectives.\n","- **Data Inspection**: Provide an initial inspection and summary of the data, allowing for an immediate understanding of its structure and key columns.\n","\n","#### Why Separate Data Loading?\n","Separating the data loading process into its own notebook allows for more manageable code and focuses on ensuring that the data integrity is maintained from the source to the analytical environment. This separation is particularly important for performance optimization when dealing with large datasets, as it allows for specific tuning and adjustments without affecting other analytical processes."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## 2.
